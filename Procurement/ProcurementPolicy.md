Procurement
CS1.0: “As new technology is required by departments, a best faith effort shall be made to ensure that all new applications conform to open data standards. This shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, software that is built by employees or contractors, procured as a hosted service, purchased, or licensed for use. DoIT shall work as a partner with individual departments to advise and help assess the feasibility of these requirements on a per project basis.”
ODPpublic: A commenter (Michelle Sohn) says “It'd be great to specifically require the Open Data Manager to work with the Procurement Office/Chief Procurement Officer to develop (where appropriate) contract provisions that promote open data policies. Chicago and San Francisco have requirements to that effect in their open data policies.”
To this end I think the RFP “data ownership” research that we worked on with Harvard might be a starting point.

Open Items: 
How strict a standard do we want to set about data ownership / open data? Do we define what constitutes “good enough?” Or, do we take a case-by-case approach?
