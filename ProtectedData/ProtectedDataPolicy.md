Protected data
Risk assessment
DG0.4: “Protected Data must be securely safeguarded.  The risk of harm corresponding to Protected Data may be greater or lesser depending the many circumstances.  Determination of adequate safeguards needed to secure Protected Data must be proportional to the corresponding risk of harm. A Risk Assessment Report must be completed in order to establish the appropriate safeguards and controls for Protected Data.”
GM1a: Looks at “reputation risk” as one factor for determining classification.

Open Items: 
Should risk assessment play a formal role in our data policy? Beyond what is required by external rules, do we need to provide different treatments for different types of protected data?

Authorization
MJWEO: Calls for “appropriate security and sharing of Protected Data” 
GM1a: Provides detailed guidance for authorization policies based on the specific classification of data.
DG0.4: “Protected Data must only be accessed on a need to know, need to perform or need to protect basis and in accordance with this policy and applicable law.  Only authorized persons may access Protected Data and such access must be revisited whenever such persons change roles within the Department.”

Open Items: 
Who grants authorization to access protected data? Is there a standard process/form? Who oversees this process? Are there external audit/compliance requirements that will cause this process to vary on a case-by-case basis? How/when is authorization reviewed and revoked?

Access control
MJWEO: Calls for “effective use of Identity and Access Management.”
DG0.4: Calls for the use of Federated Identity Accounts as a means of managing access to protected data.

Open Items: 
How much should the policy specify the details or requirements of identity management and access control solutions? Should we define general parameters?

Protection methods (storage / transmission)
GM1a: Provides detailed guidance for the storage and transmission of protected data, depending upon its classification level. Includes specific guidance on encryption, transmission mechanisms, and network technologies. 
DG0.4: “The Protected Data classification status must be continuously maintained no matter what media the data is instantiated on and no matter what business process or environment the data exists in or moves through. Special care must be afforded to the transmission, long term archive and destruction of Protected Data…Protected Data must be safeguarded by an appropriate and proportional blend of hardware, software, network, physical, organizational and other security protection and controls.”

Open Items: 
How much should the policy specify requirements for specific approaches to protecting data? Should the rules around encryption, storage, and transmission be in this policy or a separate document?

Audit
DG0.4: “Both successful and attempted unauthorized access and authorized access events should be logged.“
GM1a: Calls on Data Custodians to “monitor and review their systems and procedures for potential misuse and/or unauthorized access.”

Open Items: 
How much detail should the policy specify? Should it assign specific responsibilities for ensuring/reviewing audit trails? How will this policy interact with other external requirements/reviews?

Sharing, research, and analysis (internal and external)
MJWEO: Calls for “appropriate security and sharing of Protected Data” 
DG0.4: “The Open Data Manager shall promote and support Departments with the use of data science, analytics and business intelligence to advance the mission and goals of the City of Boston.  The Open Data Manager shall support inter-agency research to identify areas of service need in the City of Boston. “

Open Items:
Do we provide any standardize models for licensing protected data sets to aid in their use for research purposes? Having pre-defined rule sets to choose from (ala Creative Commons) might lower the barrier to safe use of protected data in a research context. Are there any 3rd party license/protection models we could use here?

How aggressively should the policy encourage the safe sharing of protected data? Do we provide guidance for lowest-risk approach that will achieve the intended goal (e.g. anonymize/aggregate where possible)?
