Authorization and Consent
DG0.4: “City of Boston web sites, apps and other services that allow individual members of the public or businesses to register or log on are encouraged to accept authorization for Protected Data Sharing granted by people using external identity accounts.  Every time consent is granted by an individual authorizing a City or Boston application to access their own Protected Data, the authorization should be reviewable, modifiable and revocable by that person.”

Open Items: 
Does this policy specify rules for collecting consent for various types of use from end-users? What kind of notification do we/should we give to people who supply us with data?
