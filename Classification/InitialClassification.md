# What are the initial classification processes and responsibilities?

* Who classifies data? DoIT or department? Is there a one-size-fits-all solution? Or, do we need to allow for some departments to self-classify (w/ external oversight) while others would be handled centrally?

## References: 

* CS1.0: “DoIT in cooperation with Corporation Counsel will create a workflow and a set of guidelines to aid departments in classifying their data. All data in the possession of the city regardless of origin should be reviewed, properly classified and cataloged by this method in order to maintain the consistency, security, and integrity of the data.” Creates role of “Open Data Manager” to aid in classification and publishing.

* GM1a: Defines role of department-level “Data Custodian” who is “responsible for determining the appropriate classification of the data,” in accordance with well-defined classification standards. Departments are allowed to create stronger restrictions than what’s called for in the document.

* DG0.4: “The CIO shall classify data for which the City of Boston is responsible on a priority basis and in consultation with the Department head serving as custodian of that data.” 

* MJWEO: Classification is done by departments based on guidance from the CIO.
