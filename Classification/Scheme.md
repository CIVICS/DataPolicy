# What classification methodology do we use? 

* How explicitly do we tie it to Public Records Law?

# How, if at all, should publicly-releasable data be extracted from protected data for publication?

* When a data set is classified as protected, do we attempt to identify a publicly-releasable version of the data (e.g. aggregated / anonymized) rather than simply deem the whole dataset protected?

* CS1.0: “Classification of each dataset shall result in an understanding of whether or not that data, in part or in full, is controlled and therefore restricted from or is an appropriate candidate for possible publication. This classification shall be in compliance with current laws regarding privacy and public records such as, but not limited to, the guidelines set forth by Massachusetts General Law as well as HIPAA, CORI, and FERPA regulations.”

* GM1a: Three classification levels. “High Sensitivity (Confidential) – Data which is legally regulated; and data that would provide access to confidential or restricted information. Medium Sensitivity (Internal) – Data which the data managers have not decided to publish or make public; and data protected by contractual obligations. Low Sensitivity (Public) – Data for which there is no expectation for privacy or confidentiality.”

* DG0.4: Classification based on MA Public Records law. Data is classified as “Public Records” or “Exempt Records.” Public records may be further designated as “Public Records - Open Data.” Exempt records may be designated as “Exempt Records - Protected Data.”

* MJWEO: Designates “Open Data” and “Protected Data.” Open Data is “public record data sets...to the extent such data sets are determined to be appropriate for public disclosure.” Protected Data is defined as “non-public data, such as health data, educational records and other protected data.”
