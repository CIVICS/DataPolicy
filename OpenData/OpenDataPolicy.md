Open data
Publication procedures
CS1.0: Provides a detailed publication workflow for appropriately classified data. Has review/approval steps and recommendations for automating publication process.
MJWEO: “All departments shall publish their public record data sets on the City of Boston open data portal”
DG0.4: “The CIO determines whether data is appropriate to be published by the City of Boston on the City of Boston Open Data Portal.”

Open Items: 
How detailed a publication process do we define? How much variation will there need to be from one department to the next? Does the process differ when DoIT controls the source database versus when the department or a 3rd party does?

Prioritizing datasets for release
CS1.0: Provides a detailed, seven-factor evaluation for prioritizing data set release: Volume, Velocity, Variability, Variety, Validity, Veracity, Value.
DG0.4: No clear process provided, however, data “may be granted a priority rating for being published on the City of Boston Open Data Portal”
ODPpublic: A commenter (Josh Weiss) says, “I think there should be a process for the community to request data and be able to weigh in on priorities.”

Open Items: 
What is our internal prioritization mechanism? Do we have a formal process to review?

Do we create a public request/input process around prioritization?

Licensing
CS1.0: Recommends Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International as the “least restrictive” option.
DG0.4: “Both Public Records and Exempt Records may also be owned by the City of Boston.  Third parties may be required to agree to the terms of one or more contracts or licenses as a condition of access to Open Data or Protected Data.  Contracts, licenses or other terms must be reviewed and approved by Corporation Counsel for the City of Boston. “

Open Items: 
Is it legally feasible for us to define a single (or default) license for all our open data sets?

Data formats
CS1.0: “DoIT shall be responsible for developing and maintaining a separate technical standards manual. This document shall serve as technical guidance for publishing various types of data and will cover formats, metadata, data schemas, documentation, APIs and publishing platforms.”
ODPpublic: “To the extent practicable, the Open Data Manager shall also facilitate collaborative efforts of multiple governmental jurisdictions and public sector entities to pool, regionalize or otherwise coordinate the publication, accessibility and interoperability of Open Data.”

Open Items: 
How formally do we want to establish standards?

What role do we have as it relates to other jurisdictions/datasets? Should we call for the use of commonly utilized standards when practical?
